# T.REX ARMS Nylon

So far, we've only open-sourced one nylon pattern:

## [Chemlight Holder](ChemlightHolder)

The Chemlight Holder is one of the simplest nylon products, which makes it a perfect candidate to be a open-source nylon pattern. Since it can easily accommodate batteries, chemlights, pens, or be used for cable management, it is a perfect candidate for modifications. You might want to make it with larger or smaller cells, or with a totally different number of cells then the four and seven that we currently offer on the website. 

The PDF file that can be printed at actual on a piece of 8.5x11” paper. This pattern will allow you to cut out the exact shapes of fabric and Velcro necessary to make your own chemlight holder. If you have a vinyl cutter, CriCut, or desktop laser cutter, you can use the digital shape files directly in your cutter’s software.

Since this is the very first of our open-source nylon patterns, we would love to hear from you. What are you trying to accomplish? What you would like to see us release in the future? What would be most useful for you as you tweak your own equipment, develop new pieces of kit, or create products that interface with T.Rex gear?
